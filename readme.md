## Tic Tac Toe


> This is a Tic Tac Toe App. A board game that I used to play with when I was a little boy. I was inspired to build this app to test my Javascript Skills. I was so happy that I was able to make one.

> Things I learned in this project;
  * How to use Arrays in storing and manipulating data.
  * How to create a tic tac toe AI opponent. (In this app the AI is not design as super difficult.)
  * How to create an app using Functional Programming.
